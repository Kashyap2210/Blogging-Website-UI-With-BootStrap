# Blogging Website UI Using HTML & CSS & BOOTSTRAP

This is a blogging website UI that I created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

HTML was used for basic structure, CSS for styling, and Bootstrap for incorporating various elements and features.

I have also included the 'tutorial.html' file, where I practiced and learned how to use Bootstrap.
